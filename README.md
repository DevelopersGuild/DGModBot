# DGModBot (ROBO)
(DISCORD) Developers' Guild Moderator Bot (ROBO)
#### NOTE
This is just the code only! You'll need the DGModBot Token in order for this program to work properly. That means if you want to edit the existing bot on the DG Discord, you'll need to contact on the Development Team Members.

### Project setup 
You'll need to install all project dependencies.
```sh
     # This will install all dependencies in the package.json
     npm install 
```
after that, your good to go!
