# DGModBot
(DISCORD) Developers' Guild Moderator Bot
#### NOTE
This is just the code only! You'll need the DGModBot Token in order for this program to work properly. That means if you want to edit the existing bot on the DG Discord, you'll need to contact on the Development Team Members.

### Project setup 
You'll need to install Discord.js into the folder first in order to run the program
```sh
     npm install discord.js
```
after that, your good to go!
